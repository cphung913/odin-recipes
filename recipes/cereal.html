    <p>
        Pouring cereal into a bowl may seem like a straightforward task, but there are a few tips to make sure you get the perfect bowl every time. First, select your favorite cereal and a bowl that's the right size. Too small and your cereal will spill over the sides; too big and your cereal may not be deep enough to stay crunchy. Next, hold the bowl steady with one hand while using the other hand to pour the cereal slowly into the bowl, aiming for the center. Once you've poured the desired amount of cereal, add your favorite milk and enjoy a delicious breakfast or snack!
