    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A PB and J sandwich is a classic American snack that is quick and easy to make. To start, gather your ingredients: bread, peanut butter, and jelly. Choose your favorite type of bread and spread a generous amount of peanut butter onto one slice. On the other slice, spread a generous amount of your favorite jelly or jam. Press the two slices together and cut the sandwich in half. You can serve it as is, or toast the bread for a warm and toasty treat. This simple recipe is perfect for a quick lunch or an on-the-go snack.
